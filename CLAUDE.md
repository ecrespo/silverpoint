# silverpoint — context for agents

Before proposing or writing any code in this repository, read
[`specs/constitution.md`](specs/constitution.md). Its nine articles are binding and every
proposal is validated against them.

## The three most often broken by inattention

1. **Art. 1** — the geometry of the encoding channel is exact. Hand inking touches only
   strokes that carry no data, and always with `preserveVertices: true`.
2. **Art. 2** — no maths in the adapters. If you are computing a scale or an arc outside
   `@silverpoint/core`, you are in the wrong place.
3. **Art. 4** — no `Math.random()` and no `Date.now()` on the render path. The seed is
   public and stable.

## Settled decisions — do not rediscover them

- Area fills use a **tile per tonal level** (`hatchFill: 'tile'`), not per-shape hatching.
  Measured: per-shape is 913 KB for a 12-card dashboard.
- The parity gate **parses and compares trees**; it never normalises strings. Each adapter is
  compared against the fixture's **canonical render**, never against a sibling adapter.
- **Nuxt is not** a validated integration: Vue SSR parity is verified with
  `@vue/server-renderer` directly.
- Typeface: **EB Garamond**, three cuts, self-hosted. **No monospace.**
- Coordinates carry **2 decimals**.
- The palette is **computed, not chosen by eye**: changing a colour requires recomputing
  contrast, and CI enforces it.
- Every white heightening carries an **ink outline** (REQ-031); without it, it fails contrast.
- **Frameworks: React, Angular and Vue.** Those three, and only those three, get an adapter
  package — they are the ones contributing a component layer.
- **Integrations: Vite, Next.js, Angular CLI.** A build tool is not a framework. Vite + React
  is React, Vite + Vue is Vue, and the Angular CLI runs on Vite. All three are validated with requirements of
  their own (REQ-033, REQ-034, REQ-103), not as demos.
- Specs are written in **English**, and so is everything else in this repository.

## Methodology

Spec-Driven Design, *spec-anchored*: `specs/` is the standing truth, `changes/` holds
active proposals. Work of medium-feature size or larger needs an approved spec before
implementation (Art. 9). Every MUST carries a `REQ-NNN`; every task and every test cites
the requirement it implements or verifies.

## Status

| Artifact | Status |
|---|---|
| Constitution | ✅ v1.4 ratified |
| PRD (EARS criteria) | ✅ v1.7 approved — 105 requirements, REQ-001..REQ-184 |
| API Spec | ✅ v1.5 approved — 33 components, 13 diagnostic codes |
| Technical Design | ✅ v1.4 approved — 12 decisions, DD-001..DD-012 |
| Data Model | ✅ v1.3 approved — verified palette, 9 invariants |
| Implementation Plan | ✅ v1.3 — 5 phases grouped by shared engine |
| Tasks | ✅ Phase 0 — 29 tasks, supervised first batch T-001..T-004 |
| Analyze | ✅ Fourth run — **READY TO IMPLEMENT**, 5 LOW findings open |

Next step: Phase 0, starting with T-001. Run the first batch (T-001 to T-004), review, then
scale. Phase 0 has a stop condition — see the Implementation Plan.
